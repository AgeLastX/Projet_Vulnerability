The script starts by asking the user if they want to send the test results via email. If the user confirms, they will be prompted to provide Microsoft login information (username, password) and the destination email address.

The script asks if the user wants to schedule a vulnerability scan task. If confirmed, the execution time will be requested, and the task will be scheduled using the CronTab library.

The script displays a menu to choose the target for vulnerability tests from the following options: Windows 7, Windows 10-11, Windows Server 2008-2012, Linux, or URLs.

For each OS or URL choice, the user can enter the corresponding IP addresses or URLs. This information is stored in a dictionary called "inventory".

Once the user finishes selecting targets, the script writes the inventory information to the "inventory.ini" file.

Next, the script executes the Ansible playbook "playbook.yaml" using the "ansible-playbook" command. It passes the Microsoft login information, destination email address, and confirmation through environment variables.

# ANSIBLE
The Ansible playbook performs the following tasks:

Uses the Nmap tool to perform port scanning on the target hosts.

Uses the Metasploit tool to perform penetration tests on the target hosts based on their groups (Windows 7, Windows Server 2008-2012, or Linux).

Uses the Nikto tool to perform vulnerability scans on the target URLs.

Cleans up result files and creates a "results.docx" file.

Generates a result report by adding the results of different tasks to the "results.docx" file.

Converts the "results.docx" file to PDF format using LibreOffice.

Sends the PDF file via email to the specified address if the confirmation is "yes".

The script ends after the execution of the Ansible playbook.
